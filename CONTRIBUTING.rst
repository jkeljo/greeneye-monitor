Setting up dev environment
==========================

This repo uses Poetry to manage its dependencies.

1. `pip install poetry` to add it to your Python installation if you don't have it already
2. `poetry install` to set up a venv with all needed dependencies
3. `poetry run pytest` (for example) to run tests
4. `poetry shell` to get a shell inside the poetry-created venv
